2. Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg (RKF) for ODE (P2-Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg-RKF-for-ODE-main)
3. Green's Function and ODE with Initial Value Problem (IVP) (P3-Green-s-Function-and-ODE-with-IVP-main)
4. Data Degradation Modeling (P4-DataDegradationModeling-main)
5. Self-Organized Criticality (P5-Self-Organized-Criticality-main)
6. Numeric Computations with Taylor Polynomials (P6-Numeric-Computations-with-Taylor-Polynomials-main)
7. Code Errors and the Butterfly Effect (P7-Code-Errors-and-the-Butterfly-Effect-main)
8. Numerical Integration (P8-Numerical-Integration-main)

## Running the Programs
To run any of the projects, you will need to have Python 3.8 and pip 3.8 installed, along with the following libraries: numpy, scipy, and matplotlib.
1. Download the repository zip file.
2. Unzip the file and locate the .py file for the project you wish to run.
3. Open the terminal and navigate to the location of the .py file.
4. Run the file using the following command: `python3 project_file_name.py` (Note: You must use `python3` and not just `python`)

## Course Overview
CST-305: Principles of Modeling and Simulation covers applications of differential equations in modeling and simulation. Students use mathematical models for continuous and discrete simulation, and develop applications for complex systems across a variety of domains. The laboratory reinforces and expands learning of principles introduced in the lecture and focuses on writing code that implements differential equation based modeling algorithms and visual simulations.
